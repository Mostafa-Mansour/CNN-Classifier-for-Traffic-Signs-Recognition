### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the data set. The classroom has a link to the data set in the "Project Instructions" content. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```

### For implementation details, you can check the [write_up]("./write_up.md") file.
